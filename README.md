# The Marvel Universal Table

If you're here, I'd imagine you already know what The Marvel Universal Table is. A friend wanted me to build him a dice roller for the Marvel table top game and I couldn't find any source of the data, so after many attempts, I landed on creating the table in JSON format and decided to make it available in the public domain.
